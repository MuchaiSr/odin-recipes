        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p class="ancestor">Matoke is a versatile staple in East African cuisine, particularly in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. 
            Unlike sweet bananas, matoke are harvested while still unripe, giving them a firm texture and a mildly starchy flavor. 
            This makes them ideal for cooking, as they absorb the flavors of spices, stews, and sauces beautifully.

            Matoke is typically boiled, steamed, or fried, and can be enjoyed in both savory and sweet dishes. 
            In many homes, it's often prepared as a hearty side dish, either mashed or cooked in chunks with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices. 
            The bananas become tender and flavorful as they absorb the seasonings during cooking, making them a comforting addition to meals like stews, meat dishes, or beans.
            Some communities equally use potatoes while cooking matoke and this enhances the flavour much more.</p>
