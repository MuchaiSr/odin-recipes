        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p class="ancestor">A meat stew is a hearty and flavorful dish made by simmering chunks of meat (such as beef, lamb, or chicken) with vegetables, herbs, and seasonings in a rich broth.
             The slow-cooking process tenderizes the meat and allows the ingredients to meld together, resulting in a savory, comforting meal. 
             Often enjoyed in colder weather, meat stews are versatile, with variations across different cultures, incorporating different spices, vegetables, and liquids like stock or wine.
             The result is a filling and nourishing meal perfect for sharing.
             This recipe will utilise the most basic ingredients to prepare the meal.
